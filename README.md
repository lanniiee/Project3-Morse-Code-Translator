Morse Code Translator:

In this project I have created a function that takes in a message in english and give back the message in morse code.

I have used TDD and jest to ensure that my functions are working as well as it should, taking in different possible cases. 

Currently the translator does not have an output for the following characters and will return "invalid character detected":
- "^"
- "("
- ")"
- "$"
- "¿"
- "¡"
- "+"
- "_"
- ";"
